As
you
have
hopefully
seen,
the
College
has
successfully
petitioned
the
Institute
Graduate
Curriculum
Committee
to
accept
several
changes
to
the
MS
CS:
•
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
credit
hours
required
for
the
MS
CS
from
36
to
30
•
a
requirement
for
a
minimum
of
15
credit
hours
in
each
of
our
specializations
•
the
consolidation
of
several
highly
overlapping
specializations
into
a
single
specialization
called
Computing
Systems
As
always,
these
changes
still
must
be
approved
by
the
GT
Faculty
Senate
and
then
by
the
Board
of
Regents
in
April.
Pending
these
approvals,
the
change
will
go
into
effect
in
Fall
2015,
and
anyone
enrolled
next
Fall
or
after
will
be
able
to
graduate
under
the
new
catalog
requirements.
Once
approved,
these
changes
will
make
their
way
onto
our
website,
but
here
are
the
most
important
changes
to
the
specializations:
IMPORTANT
NOTES
FOR
OMS
CS
STUDENTS:
Ø These
changes
include
the
specializations
and
courses
also
available
to
our
on-­‐campus
counterparts.
As
OMS
CS
students,
remember
that
you
have
limited
options
for
specializations
and
courses.
I
have
highlighted
what
is
currently
offered
online.
As
you
know
we
will
add
more
courses
in
future
semesters.
Ø CS
6035,
6238,
6260,
6262,
6340,
and
6400
are
planned
for
production
this
year
and
next.
Ø Remember
that
whatever
specialization
you
choose,
the
remaining
hours
that
will
total
30
credit
hours
are
other
OMS
CS
courses
(to
be
used
as
“electives”).
Ø You
will
be
able
to
switch
your
catalog
year
to
the
new
program
requirements,
once
they
are
fully
approved.
I
will
explain
that
process
at
a
later
date.
Four
overlapping
specializations
will
be
deactivated:
•
Architecture
•
Databases
and
Software
Engineering
•
Information
Security
•
Networking
There
is
a
new
consolidated
specialization,
